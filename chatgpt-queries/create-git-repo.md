Query: how do I create a git repo for the shop service in github using the git cli

Response:
Here are the general steps to create a Git repository for the "Shop" service on GitHub using the Git CLI:

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

Initialize a new Git repository by running git init in the project directory. This will create a new .git directory in the project directory.

Add all the files in your project to the Git repository by running git add ..

Commit the files to the repository by running git commit -m "Initial commit".

Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.

In the terminal, add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local repository by running git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git. Replace <username> and <repository-name> with your GitHub username and the name of the repository you just created.

Push the local repository to the GitHub repository by running git push -u origin master. This will upload the files in your local repository to the GitHub repository.

Now you can check your repository in your GitHub account, you should see your codebase and files in it.

With these steps, you should now have a Git repository for the "Shop" service on GitHub that you can use to track changes and collaborate with others.
