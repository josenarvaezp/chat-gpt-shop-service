Query: write a dockerfile to run the shop service

Response:
```
FROM golang:latest

# Create app directory
RUN mkdir /app

# Add the source code
ADD . /app/

# Change working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Build the app
RUN go build -o shop-service .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 9090

# Run the app
CMD ["./shop-service"]
```

This is a basic example of a Dockerfile that can be used to run the "Shop" service.
This Dockerfile uses the latest version of the official Golang image as a base.
It creates an app directory and then copies the entire codebase to the app directory in the container.
It then sets the working directory to the app directory and runs go build command to build the service.
It exposes port 9090 so that the service can be reached from the host.
And finally, it runs the command to start the service.
You may have to adjust the commands and instructions according to your specific implementation.
You can build the image using the command docker build -t shop-service . and then you can run the container using docker run -p 9090:9090 shop-service
