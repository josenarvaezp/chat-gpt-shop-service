Query: how do I create a go project to host the shop service

Response:
Here are the general steps to create a Go project to host the "Shop" service:

Create a new directory for your project.

Initialize a new Go module by running go mod init <module-name> in the project directory. This will create a new go.mod file in the project directory.

Create a new directory called proto within your project directory. This is where you will put your .proto file for the "Shop" service.

Generate the Go code for the "Shop" service by running the following command in the proto directory:
protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. <your_proto_file>.proto
this will generate the Go code for the service based on the proto file.

Create a new directory called server within your project directory. This is where you will put the server implementation for the "Shop" service.

Implement the "Shop" service by creating a new Go file in the server directory and copy-pasting the Go code from the previous example into this file. Make sure to import the necessary dependencies and use the correct package name for your project.

Create a new Go file called main.go in the project directory. This file will contain the code to start the gRPC server and register the "Shop" service. Here's an example of what the main.go file could look like:
```
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net"

	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"github.com/your_package_name/your_proto_package_name"
)

func main() {
	lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":9090")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
	}

	s := grpc.NewServer()
	your_proto_package_name.RegisterShopServer(s, &server{})

	if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
	}
}
```

This file creates a new gRPC server, registers the "Shop" service with it, and starts the server on port 9090.

Build and run the project by running go build in the project directory and then running the generated binary.
Please note that this is just a basic example of how to create a Go project to host a gRPC service, and there are many other ways to structure and organize a Go project.
Also, you may want to use a dependency management tool like dep or go modules to manage the dependencies in your project.
